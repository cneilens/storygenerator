COLIN (age 3, chubby, tousled blonde hair, blue eyes, always a bit disheveled) sits in the grass, banging pot lids with wooden spoons, grinning at the noise. \n\nMONTAGE \u2013 COLIN GROWING UP\n\n- INT. FAMILY LIVING ROOM \u2013 NIGHT \u2013 1969\nColin (age 7, slightly taller but still chubby, hair a bit longer, blue eyes) strums a toy guitar, mimicking Angus Young's duck walk. His mother, MRS. TURNER (40s, kind, brown hair), smiles.\n\n- INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM \u2013 DAY \u2013 1974\nColin (age 12) on stage, playing bass in a school talent show. His hair is shaggier, his shirt untucked. His friends cheer him from the audience.\n\n- INT. GARAGE \u2013 NIGHT \u2013 1978\nColin (age 16) with his first real band, THE WILD BUNCH. Colin sings into a mic, sweat on his brow, messy hair, wearing a faded Led Zeppelin tee. His bandmates are just as unruly. The music is loud and rough.\n\n- INT. SMALL CLUB \u2013 NIGHT \u2013 1985\nColin (age 23) on stage, now the frontman of IRON SHADOWS. The crowd is sparse, but Colin gives it his all, headbanging, hair sticking to his forehead. \n\n- INT. APARTMENT \u2013 NIGHT \u2013 1993\nColin (age 31) sits alone, surrounded by old band flyers and demo tapes. He picks up a guitar, strums softly, and sighs, looking at a Nirvana poster on the wall. \n\n- INT. REHEARSAL SPACE \u2013 DAY \u2013 1995\nColin (age 33) rallies a new group of musicians, encouraging them through laughter and missed notes. He\u2019s still chubby, hair now shoulder-length, a bit more tired but energetic.\n\n- EXT. MUSIC FESTIVAL STAGE \u2013 NIGHT \u2013 2003\nColin (age 41) finally on a big stage with his band, THE TURNERS. Bright lights. Huge crowd. Colin, older, heavier, and happier than ever, rips into a guitar solo. \n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BACKSTAGE \u2013 NIGHT\nColin, sweaty and exhausted, looks into a mirror. He straightens his messy hair and smiles at his reflection.\n\nCOLIN (V.O.):\nIt really is a long way to the top...\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MAIN STAGE \u2013 NIGHT\nColin stands under a dazzling sign made of lights: \"It's a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll.\" He grins, raises his guitar, and launches into a final triumphant riff as the crowd roars.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nEND TITLE CARD: IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP IF YOU WANT TO ROCK N ROLL.",
