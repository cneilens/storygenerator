  "prompt": "Colin had a bad day, he was down on his luck and out of beer. He was a large overweight 50 year old man, balding with mousey blonde hair that was turning grey. \nHe left the bar walking the streets of downtown Vancouver BC,  looking worse for wearing carrying what little he had in a red and white polka dotted bindle. \nAfter walking for a while he comes across a Circus big top with a crowd of performers outside attracting punters. \nColin was fascinated by the performers, he scrapes up his last remaining cash and manages to buy a ticket. \nHe watches that nights performance and is totally amazed by the show. \nAt the end of the show he sees the ring master and tells him his story. \nThe ringmaster takes sympathy and hires Colin. \nColin is made up, first he is happy just to brush up the animal mess in the Circus Ring.\nHis hard work and eagerness earns him a promotion to ticket sales. \nHe loves it, but then one day he talks to the other performers and they persuade him to try the trapeze. \nHe cautiously climbed up the ladder to the very top, takes hold of the trapeze and swings down into the circus. \nThe other performers clap and cheer and welcome him into their group. \nFrom there he tries various acts, juggling, lion taming, horse back riding, being fired from a cannon as a human cannon ball, knife throwing, stunt tricylist. \nHe never got over his experience on the trapeze but he did one day attempt the high wire even though the wire could only be raised six inches off the floor! \nHe then found his dream job. A clown! \nHe loved making people laugh and the silly costumes. \nHe wore full clown face paint, loud clothes, colorful wigs and the big shoes. \nEverything about it he loved, from fake falls, throwing fake water over other clowns and driving the clown car. \nUntil one night when during his performance he squirted water from a flower in his lapel into the RingMasters face. \nThe Ringmaster was not happy and that night they had a big row, Colin was fired. \nAll the performers were angry with him as they were now one person down. \nColin drove off into the sunset in the clown car. \nHe was broke again, but at least he had his car and clown costume. \nThen just as he arrived back n Vancouver, the care broke down. \nBubbles were spewing out of the engine but Colin knew nothing about engines and only had enough money from one more beer. \nOff to his favourite bar he went in full clown costume, back to where it all started.",
