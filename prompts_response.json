    "script": "Title: 'Long Way to the Top'\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD \u2013 DAY \u2013 EARLY 1960s\n\nA toddler, COLIN (2), blonde, blue-eyed, slightly chubby, sits on a blanket in the grass banging on toy drums. The sun is shining. His mother, MRS. JONES (early 30s), watches lovingly from a lawn chair.\n\n                        MRS. JONES (V.O.)\n            From the moment he could hold a spoon, Colin wanted to be a rock star.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. COLIN'S BEDROOM \u2013 NIGHT\n\nColin (5), now with messy, chin-length blonde hair, strums a plastic guitar, eyes closed, lost in the music from a small radio blaring AC/DC.\n\n                        MRS. JONES (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n            He loved the wild guitars, the pounding drums\u2026\n\nMONTAGE: (1960s)\n\n- Colin (7), slightly chubby, hair a bit longer, bashes on pots and pans with chopsticks.\n- Colin (10), messy hair, practices on a cheap electric guitar, posters of Led Zeppelin and The Beatles on his wall.\n- Colin (12), nervously plays in the school talent show, his parents clapping in the audience.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. GARAGE \u2013 EVENING \u2013 1970s\n\nColin (16), now a teen, still chubby, messy shoulder-length blonde hair, jams with two friends. They\u2019re loud, unpolished, but passionate. A homemade \"The Thunderbolts\" sign hangs crookedly behind them.\n\n                        COLIN\n            Let\u2019s take it from the top!\n\nQuick cuts:\n- Colin singing into a hairbrush in the mirror, face serious.\n- Colin practicing guitar until his fingers bleed.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. SMALL CLUB \u2013 NIGHT \u2013 1980s\n\nColin (25), adult, slightly overweight, scruffy, shoulder-length hair, loads gear with new bandmates. Neon sign: \"Metal Storm Tonight!\"\n\nINT. SMALL CLUB \u2013 LATER\n\nThe band plays to a nearly empty house. Colin sings his heart out, sweat dripping, hair plastered to his forehead.\n\n                        COLIN (V.O.)\n            Some nights it felt like no one cared. But I couldn\u2019t stop.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. APARTMENT \u2013 NIGHT\n\nColin (30), alone, scribbles lyrics in a notebook. He looks determined but tired. A Metallica poster hangs above his desk.\n\n                        COLIN (V.O.) (CONT\u2019D)\n            For every door that closed, I wrote a new song.\n\nMONTAGE: (1990s)\n\n- Colin (35), slightly heavier, hair a bit shorter, rehearses with a new band, clashing egos.\n- Colin (38), blue-eyed, smiling, performing at a wedding.\n- Colin (40), frustrated, arguing with a bandmate, then sighing and packing up his guitar.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. STUDIO \u2013 DAY \u2013 2000s\n\nColin (45), still slightly chubby, now with shoulder-length, slightly thinning blonde hair, leads a group through a recording session. The band is tight, the sound is polished.\n\n                        PRODUCER\n            That\u2019s the take! We\u2019ve got it!\n\nColin beams. He exchanges high-fives with the band.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CONCERT VENUE \u2013 NIGHT\n\nA huge neon sign: \"Rockfest 2005 \u2013 Main Stage.\"\n\nINT. BACKSTAGE \u2013 NIGHT\n\nColin (46), a bit older, but still energetic, tunes his guitar. He looks in a mirror, adjusts his messy hair, and smiles nervously.\n\n                        COLIN (V.O.)\n            It took me forty years\u2026\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. STAGE \u2013 NIGHT\n\nColin steps into the spotlight. The crowd roars. He launches into an electrifying performance.\n\nSLOW MOTION:\nColin, blue-eyed, slightly chubby, shoulder-length blonde hair, sweat flying, fingerpicking his guitar, lost in the music.\n\nABOVE THE STAGE \u2013 NEON LIGHTS:\n\n            \"IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP IF YOU WANT TO ROCK N ROLL.\"\n\nColin looks up, a tear in his eye, smiles and plays harder.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nEND.",
